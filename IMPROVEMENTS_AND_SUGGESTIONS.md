# Improvements and Suggestions for FoodDropSystem.lua

This document outlines potential improvements for the `FoodDropSystem.lua` module.

## Suggestions

1.  **Centralize Tags in `CollectionServiceTags`**:
    *   **Issue**: The string `"Consumable"` is hardcoded in `FoodDropSystem.lua`. 
    *   **Suggestion**: Add a `CONSUMABLE` field to the `CollectionServiceTags` module to avoid magic strings and improve maintainability.

2.  **More Robust Unique Naming**:
    *   **Issue**: `tick()` is used for generating unique food model names. While likely sufficient, it could theoretically produce collisions in high-frequency scenarios.
    *   **Suggestion**: For greater robustness, consider using a simple incrementing counter or a dedicated UUID library if available.

3.  **Use a Raycast Whitelist**:
    *   **Issue**: The raycast in `getDropPosition` uses a blacklist to ignore the `foodFolder`. This could allow food to spawn on unintended objects.
    *   **Suggestion**: Switch to a whitelist to ensure food only spawns on designated surfaces like terrain.

4.  **Tag-Based Cooking Surface Detection**:
    *   **Issue**: Cooking surfaces are detected by checking model names with `string.find`, which can be error-prone.
    *   **Suggestion**: Use `CollectionService` to add a `"CookingSurface"` tag to all valid cooking models. This makes detection more explicit and reliable.

5.  **Optimize `onTouched` Function**:
    *   **Issue**: The `isCooked` check is performed after other checks in the `onTouched` function.
    *   **Suggestion**: Move the `isCooked` check to the beginning of the function to exit earlier and improve efficiency.

6.  **Deferred Destruction with `Debris` Service**:
    *   **Issue**: Destroying a creature's model (`model:Destroy()`) synchronously in the `die()` function of `BaseCreature.lua` can cause a lag spike.
    *   **Suggestion**: Use the `Debris` service (`Debris:AddItem(model, 0)`) to defer the destruction of the model to the next frame. This will prevent the main game thread from being blocked and will result in a smoother experience.
