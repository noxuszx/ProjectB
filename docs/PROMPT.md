Your plan covers all the missing pieces and lines up with best-practice patterns. I’d give it a green light with just a few minor tweaks:

1. Tagging helper  
   • Instead of the nested `tagStructureParts` / `tagVillageParts` functions everywhere, add one generic utility in `CollectionServiceTags`:

function CollectionServiceTags.tagDescendants(root, tag)
    for _, inst in ipairs(root:GetDescendants()) do
        if inst:IsA("BasePart") then
            CollectionServiceTags.addTag(inst, tag)
        end
    end
    CollectionServiceTags.addTag(root, tag) -- tag the root model too
end
Then each spawner only needs a one-liner:
CollectionServiceTags.tagDescendants(clone, CollectionServiceTags.PROTECTED_CORE)
2. Protection zones  
   • Invisible “protection zone” Parts are fine, but lets skip them if the building’s own BaseParts already cover its footprint—only keep them where a single small spawner part needs extra padding.

3. Refresh cadence  
   • Refreshing every 5 s is safe.  
   • During the world-generation phase you could also call `initializeOverlapParams()` once *after* VillageSpawner and CoreStructureSpawner finish; that avoids unnecessary polling.

4. Execution order  
   • CoreStructureSpawner → VillageSpawner → SpawnerPlacement already happens before CustomModelSpawner.init() is invoked, so one refresh at the start of CustomModelSpawner is enough. The periodic refresh is a fallback in case something spawns later (e.g. dynamic spawners).

5. Debug helpers  
   • Good idea—wrap them with `if ModelSpawnerConfig.DEBUG then … end`.

With those small refinements, the plan is solid.  
Ready for implementation whenever you are.
