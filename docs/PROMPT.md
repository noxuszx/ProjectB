Inventory/Backpack system review (server-side focus)

A. What’s solid already  
• Central table per–player, cleaned up on PlayerRemoving.  
• Cool-downs to stop spam.  
• Tag-based “can store?” filter – extensible and designer-friendly.  
• Objects are pooled in ServerStorage, so you never destroy valuable meshes.

B. Immediate bug that produces  
“The Parent property of Workspace is locked” (SellZoneHandler line 120)  

Why it happens  
`onSellZoneTouched()` assumes `hit.Parent` is the sellable item.  
When an *un-grouped* Part touches the zone its parent **is Workspace**.  
A few lines later you call `item:Destroy()` (line 120).  
Because `item == workspace`, Roblox tries to re-parent Workspace and throws the error.

Quick, safe fix in SellZoneHandler  
Add a guard right after you build `item`:

if item == workspace then                -- ignore lone parts / terrain hits
    return
end
(or more generically `if not item:IsDescendantOf(workspace) or item == workspace then return`).

C. BackpackService – professional-grade tweaks

1. Don’t move pooled items to ServerStorage  
   • `Parent` change forces a full replicate/destroy cycle.  
   • Instead, hide them in-place exactly like your CashPool approach:
     - `object.Parent = workspace`
     - `object.CFrame = HIDDEN_POS`
     - transparency / collisions off  
   • This eliminates the marshal hit and the “Parent property locked” risk.

2. Store metadata, not the physical Instance  
   • Most studios keep only `{assetId, attributes}` in the backpack table, destroy the real object, and recreate it from ReplicatedStorage when the player drops it.  
   • Advantage: memory stays low, no pooled clutter, and security (the client can’t grab the object while it’s in ServerStorage).

3. Expose RemoteFunctions for client sync rather than polling  
   • Right now clients must request `getBackpackContents`.  
   • Fire a `BackpackChanged` RemoteEvent whenever size changes; UI updates instantly, no polling.

D. Suggested next steps  
1. Patch SellZoneHandler with the workspace guard.  
2. Decide whether to adopt “hide in place” pooling for backpack items; if yes, the code is almost identical to CashPoolManager.  
3. If you need fixed-slot inventory or client events I can sketch that out.

Let me know which of these changes you’d like applied and we'll prepare the code edits.
