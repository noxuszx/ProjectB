Here are the issues I noticed that make MeshPart support unreliable (or outright crash) in `src/server/spawning/CustomModelSpawner.lua`.

1. Wrong API for scaling MeshParts  
   • `model:ScaleTo(scaleFactor)` only exists on `Model`.  
   • A `MeshPart` has no `ScaleTo` method, so the call at line 169 errors whenever a MeshPart is chosen.  
   • Fix: branch the scaling logic:
     if model:IsA("Model") then
         model:ScaleTo(scaleFactor)
     elseif model:IsA("MeshPart") then
         model.Size *= scaleFactor            -- uniform scale
     end
2. Typo in helper name  
   • `selecRnum` (line 82) ➜ should be something like `selectRandom`.  
   • It still works, but the typo makes the code harder to read and invites copy-paste bugs elsewhere.

3. Missing primary part check  
   • `model:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(...)` (lines 162, 189) will throw if the cloned model has no `PrimaryPart`.  
   • Most MeshPart assets are single parts, so the `MeshPart` branch is hit; but if a model without a primary part sneaks in you’ll get runtime errors.  
   • Fix: validate or assign a primary part before calling.

4. Bounding-box probe is inconsistent for single parts  
   • `GetBoundingBox()` on a `MeshPart` returns its own CFrame/size, which is fine, but the subsequent embed calculations (173-184) assume the object’s “bottom” should rest on terrain.  
   • For oddly-shaped meshparts you may need a per-asset “pivot offset” instead of a fixed embed percentage.

5. Scaling before positioning may put parts underground  
   • The scale is chosen before the bounding-box ground-fit step, but the ground-fit step uses the *scaled* size.  
   • That’s correct in principle, but if you switch to direct `MeshPart.Size` scaling be sure to update `size` only after scaling (i.e., call `GetBoundingBox()` again).

6. `OverlapParams.FilterDescendantsInstances` excludes the folders that will hold spawned models, but not the models themselves.  
   • Immediately after a chunk is generated, subsequent spawns in the same session can overlap because the new instances are not explicitly excluded.  
   • Consider adding the just-chosen `templateModel` (or its class) to the exclude list, or caching the spawned parts and excluding them.

7. Hard-coded chunk width (32) in `isPositionValid`  
   • If `chunkSize` is ever changed, distance checks become inconsistent.

8. Minor style/robustness issues  
   • `scanAvailableModels()` logs “model:” even for meshparts (line 48).  
   • Typo in log: “Found … meshpart:” would be clearer.  
   • Several magic numbers (`0.1`, `0.15`, `0.05`) could move to config so mesh and model assets can tune ground embed per category.

Summary of the critical fix: guard the `ScaleTo` call and apply a Size-based uniform scale path for MeshParts. Once that’s in place the frequent “attempt to call ScaleTo” crash disappears and other refinements can be addressed incrementally.
