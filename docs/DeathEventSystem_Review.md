Overall: solid, aligned with your project’s patterns. I like that it:
•  Disables auto-respawn and replaces it with a simple, manual choice.
•  Uses predeclared RemoteEvents and manual Studio UI (consistent with your UI conventions).
•  Keeps server authoritative for respawn.

A few suggestions to keep it reliable and simple (and avoid overengineering):

1) Scope and naming of RemoteEvents
•  Keep it minimal to start:
•  Remotes/Death/ShowUI
•  Remotes/Death/RequestRespawn
•  Defer BackToLobby until it actually does something. If you want to keep the button visible, wire it to a no-op on the client for now and omit the server RemoteEvent until ready.
•  Namespace them under Remotes/Death to mirror the Economy pattern and keep Remotes tidy.

2) Where to put the logic
•  You can keep everything in PlayerDeathHandler.server.lua for v1:
•  Set Players.CharacterAutoLoads = false once at startup.
•  On humanoid.Died, ragdoll (existing), then fire ShowUI and start a 30s server-side timer to auto-respawn.
•  Handle RequestRespawn by calling player:LoadCharacter().
•  Only split out a dedicated DeathService.server.lua if PlayerDeathHandler is getting noisy or if you foresee more features (teleport to lobby, stats, analytics). For “simple and reliable,” keeping it in one place is fine.

3) Countdown and timing
•  Let the server enforce the 30s timeout (task.delay or similar) and call LoadCharacter() if no choice was made.
•  The client can display a local countdown (30 → 0) after receiving ShowUI. Minor drift is acceptable here. If you want slightly better UX, include the timeoutSeconds in ShowUI so the client knows what to render, but don’t overcomplicate with clock sync.

4) Death state and debouncing
•  Track a simple per-player flag (isDead) on the server to prevent duplicate ShowUI fires and double respawns.
•  Clear that flag on LoadCharacter() and when the player leaves.
•  Guard RequestRespawn so it only works if isDead is true.

5) CharacterAutoLoads and initial character
•  With CharacterAutoLoads = false, ensure players get a character initially. Common, simple pattern:
•  On Players.PlayerAdded, call player:LoadCharacter() once.
•  Also handle Players.PlayerAdded/CharacterAdded connections in the same place you set CharacterAutoLoads.

6) Cleanup and UI lifecycle
•  Client: hide the Death UI on:
•  receiving a “character spawned” signal (CharacterAdded) or
•  after sending RequestRespawn (optimistic hide).
•  Server: when respawning (manual or timeout), ensure no leftover timers by cancelling/ignoring via the isDead flag.

7) Ragdoll interaction
•  Your current ragdoll flow should remain unchanged—trigger ragdoll on death as you do now, then show the UI. Just make sure any ragdoll cleanup happens on respawn, as usual.

8) Back to Lobby placeholder
•  If no lobby yet, I’d keep the button disabled/hidden for now to avoid user confusion. If you want it shown, consider a tooltip “Coming soon” and do not add the server RemoteEvent yet.

Minimal first implementation checklist
•  default.project.json
•  Add Remotes/Death folder:
◦  ShowUI (RemoteEvent)
◦  RequestRespawn (RemoteEvent)
•  src/server/player/PlayerDeathHandler.server.lua
•  Set Players.CharacterAutoLoads = false
•  On PlayerAdded: player:LoadCharacter()
•  On humanoid.Died: set isDead, FireAllClients(or FireClient) ShowUI(player, 30), start 30s timeout → if still isDead then player:LoadCharacter(), clear isDead
•  On RequestRespawn.OnServerEvent: if isDead then player:LoadCharacter(), clear isDead
•  src/client/ui/DeathUI.client.lua
•  WaitForChild StarterGui/DeathGui (Studio-created)
•  Listen to Remotes.Death.ShowUI to show and start a local 30s countdown
•  Respawn button fires Remotes.Death.RequestRespawn
•  Hide on CharacterAdded or after requesting respawn
•  Studio UI
•  DeathGui > DeathFrame > TitleLabel, TimerLabel, ButtonFrame > RespawnButton (Lobby button optional)

Why this keeps it simple and reliable
•  Few moving parts: one server script (or keep it in the existing one), one client script, two remotes.
•  Server remains authoritative on death/respawn while the client only displays UI and sends intent.
•  Fits your existing patterns (manual UI, predefined Remotes, services only if needed).
