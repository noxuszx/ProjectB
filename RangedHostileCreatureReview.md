# Ranged Hostile Creature Implementation Review

## Overall Impression
You followed the existing architecture very well—behaviour-driven, config-driven, server-authoritative damage, and LOD-friendly. The code will slot neatly into the current AIManager loop.

## Strengths
1. Consistency with existing patterns (inherits HostileCreature, uses same Behavior strategy).
2. Flat config fields keep access simple (`creatureConfig.Damage`, etc.).
3. ProjectileService centralises raycast, damage, and visual payload—DRY and secure.
4. LOS check is throttled (0.2 s) and uses a shared ignore list, so it won’t blow the budget.
5. Fire-cooldown and optimal-range logic are encapsulated on the creature, not in the behaviour, which is good for tuning.

## Key Issues / Suggestions

1. Nil-safe Behaviour Checks  
```lua
if self.currentBehavior.behaviorName ~= "Roaming" then
```
will error if `currentBehavior` is ever nil (e.g. after die() or future refactors).  
Replace with  
```lua
local name = self.currentBehavior and self.currentBehavior.behaviorName or ""
if name ~= "Roaming" then ...
```
(repeat for “RangedChasing” and “RangedAttack”).

2. Global Weapon-Range Validation Clash  
`WeaponConfig.GlobalSettings.MaxRange` is still 20, but SkeletonArrow’s Range = 120.  
If any code calls `WeaponConfig.validateConfig()` it will emit “Invalid range value”.  
- Raise `MaxRange` to something like 300, or  
- Skip validation for NPC-only weapons.

3. ProjectileService Shared RaycastParams  
You mutate the same `raycastParams` object each call (`FilterDescendantsInstances = …`).  
Rare but possible race condition if two threads call fire() simultaneously.  
Either clone a new params each call or create a small pool—cost is negligible.

4. Spawn Table  
SkeletonArcher is in `CreatureTypes`, but not in `SpawnSettings.CreatureWeights`; the spawner won’t pick it yet. Add e.g.  
```lua
SkeletonArcher = 6,
```

5. Minor Perf Nit  
In `RangedHostile.update()` you re-require `BaseCreature` each frame:  
```lua
local BaseCreature = require(script.Parent.Base)
BaseCreature.update(self, deltaTime)
```  
Move the `require` to the top of the file so Lua doesn’t look it up every tick (small but free gain).

6. Behaviour Ping-Pong Guard  
`manageBehaviors()` switches to RangedChasing/Attack, and those behaviours can switch back. That’s fine, but turn on `AIConfig.Debug.LogBehaviorChanges` during a test session to confirm it doesn’t oscillate each frame near the ±5-stud tolerance. If it does, widen the hysteresis window or add a cooldown before switching again.

7. Animation Lookup  
Works, but if a model is missing an “Animations” folder you’ll get repeated warnings every spawn. Maybe only warn once or gate behind a debug flag.

## Nice-to-Have Improvements
- Add LOD awareness: In `RangedAttack:update` skip LOS & fire checks when `creature.lodLevel == "Far"`—saves CPU on distant NPCs.
- Consider object pooling for arrow tracer parts on the client (depends on shot volume).
- Expand ProjectileService.fire() to optionally restrict `FireAllClients` by radius for big games.

## Next Steps
After the nil-safety patch, range constant tweak, and spawn weight, you should be ready to test in Studio with 20-50 SkeletonArchers to confirm performance and combat feel.

Let me know if you’d like me to apply those quick fixes automatically.
